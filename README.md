# R-Project

### Disclaimer
This Project was realized in the context of my fifth year of study at ECE Paris engineering school. It is a R Shiny app developped to show insights of AirBnb listings for different cities

### First Steps
You can take a look at the html documentation:

Presentation/Presentation.html

You can try the application yourself using this link :

### Reproducibility

To reproduce the app, you have to put script folder inside Application folder
and uncomment the lines 93 - 95 - 99 of *Utils* script to generate the cleaned data

then you can recomment those line to avoid useless downloading of the dataset on each run of the application
